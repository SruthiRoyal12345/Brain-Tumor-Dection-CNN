The brain tumor detection project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify brain tumors in MRI images. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable system to help doctors diagnose brain disorders more easily. We use Python along with TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN model. This project shows how CNNs can be used in medical imaging to improve healthcare and make diagnoses faster and more effective.
